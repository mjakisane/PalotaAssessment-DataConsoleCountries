# Palota Assessment - Country facts

This is an assessment project for C# backend developers.

The focus is data manipulation and structures.

## Steps

1. Get list of countries from REST call, https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
2. Use included Country class and convert REST call to that type
3. Use data manipulation and data structures to populate the fact statements

### N.B.

- Make sure to consider the appropriate data structures to ensure good performance
- Use inbuilt methods where appropriate (as opposed to writing your own version)
- Use boilerplate methods
